<h1 style="text-align:center;"><b>Computer Science</b></h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h3>Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information. Computer science spans
    theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, information theory, and automation) to
    practical disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).Computer science
    is generally considered an academic discipline and distinct from computer programming which is considered to be a
    technical field.

Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science. The theory of computation
    concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them.
    The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and
    for preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation
    of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes,
    and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data.</h3></p>
